**Objective: Learn how to build a simple E-commerce store application using Streamlit (for the frontend) and MySQL (for the backend database).**

The aim is to gain hands-on experience with:

* Designing and creating relational databases (MySQL).

* Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

* Connecting Streamlit apps with databases.

* Displaying and interacting with data in a user-friendly interface.

* This project can be done in pairs or individually.

* Working in Teams: Nur and Astrid

Create Research on Session states for "place order" and "quantity"
